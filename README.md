# TheLastWizard-Game
Hey! This is the game I made for the final project of my Grade 12 Computer Science Course. I was able to apply the OOP Principles I learned throughout the course here in this game. I am very satisfied with the final product, because of the framework I was able to build from scratch. I developed the game such that adding new enemies or spells is very easy; simply put together a new sprite and some new “stats” (speed, damage, etc) and the arrayLists & CheckCollisions methods will do the rest!

The game uses LibGDX, a free open source API for game development. 

Thanks, I hope you enjoy my game!
